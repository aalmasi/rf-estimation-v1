This package provides a graphical user interface (GUI) written in MATLAB, for analysing neural data.

The package has the capacity of doing online analysis during electrophysiology experiments.
The package allows the following:
- plotting pre- and post-stimulus time histograms of the neuronal recordings
- plotting the tuning curve measurements
- characterising the neuronal receptive fields by
    . performing exploratory statistical feature extraction analysis e.g. spike-triggered average and covariance analyses (PCA)
    . applying statistical model fitting e.g. single or multi-dimensional generalised linear model


To initiate the GUI, run the file MEA_v2.m in MATLAB. To set the default parameters and directories in the GUI open and edit getParams.m script.
